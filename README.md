# simple-web-based-calculator
#his project is a simple web-based calculator that performs basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The application features a user interface with input fields #for two numbers, a dropdown menu to select an operator, and a button to calculate and display the result dynamically on the page.

#Key Features:
#Input fields: Two number inputs for user-provided values.

#Operation selection: A dropdown (select) with available operators (+, -, *, /).

#Calculation: The calculate() function validates input, performs the selected operation, and displays the result (or an error message for invalid input or division by zero).

#Responsive UI: Clean and modern styling with CSS (contrasting colors, rounded corners, hover effects on buttons).

#Additional Notes:
#Input validation: Checks for empty fields and ensures entered values are numbers.

#Error handling: Clear error messages (e.g., "Cannot divide by zero!").

#Scalability: Easy to extend with new operators or themes (e.g., dark mode).

#The code is well-structured, readable, and ready for further enhancements.

#Technologies Used:
#HTML (structure),

#CSS (styling),

#JavaScript (logic and interactivity).

#A functional and user-friendly project, developed as part of academic coursework.
